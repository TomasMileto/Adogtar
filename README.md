# Adogtar
Pet adoption system written in PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, using HTTP server Apache and MySql for the DataBase.\
Allows the user to give in adoption, adopt and provide or give transit to an animal.

This is the Final Project for the subject "Programming Laboratory IV" of my Technical degree in Programming, being the most recent software development I made.

In addition to these technologies, I implemented the MVC pattern (Models, Views and Controllers) and made sure to validate all incoming data, checking for SQL injections.\
The development process together with the dicted classes really brought me a solid understanding of how to approach a bigger web site.
